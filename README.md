#LOW CODE ASSIGNMENTS PART 2 - Pycaret Low Code Assignment

Deliverables: 
You are going to do example colabs for below tasks 
a) you should be able to clone partly the colabs but you need to execute it successfully in your environment - i will look into the colabs you checkin 
b) you need to do a long video tutorial - going over each of the colab and explaining in 1 minute each what the colab does - this should be your run not the github or copy - you should show it is running in your colab.  you can chunk video tutorials into parts if you want. you need to walk thru each of  colab and explain what is happening.
Neatly organize your github directory with proper readme file - i will randomly load and execute some colabs during corrections. 


Answer:
Pycaret: It is an open source Machine Learning Library in Python and automates ML workflows. It is used to replace 100 lines of code with few lines only.
It contains many ML libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

There are five steps in Pycaret.
1. Setup - prepares the data for modeling by performing preprocessing tasks.
2. Compare Models - train and evaluate multiple models
3. Analyse Model - Visualiser the performance of model and finalise model
4. Prediction - Predicting the model
5. Save - Save the model

Machine Learning Algorithms using Pycaret:

a) Classification:
  1. Binary Classification - Classifies two categories.

  2. MultiClass Classification - Classifies multiple categories

  3. Regression - used to predict continuous values based on one or more variables

b) Clustering - Used to identify distinct groups within the data.

c) Anamoly Detection - Used to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data. Eg: Fraud detection

d) Association Rule Mining - Find frequent itemsets and generate association rules, which show relationships between products that are often bought together.

e) Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables - Predict future values based on previously observed time-stamped data.
   Exogenous Variables - Exogenous variables are external factors or variables that are not part of the time series you are predicting, but can have an impact on it.
